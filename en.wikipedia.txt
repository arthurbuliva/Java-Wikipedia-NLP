The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid[1][2] and the liquid changes into a vapor.
Melting, or fusion, is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid.
Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimal rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest.[1]
In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium.[1]
Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or gluten sensitivity[1] is a clinical entity induced by the ingestion of gluten leading to intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms that resolve once the gluten-containing foodstuff is eliminated from the diet, and when celiac disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out.[2]
